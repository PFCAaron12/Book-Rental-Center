# Data Analytics Project – End-to-End Analysis & Visualization
# Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow, from loading raw data into a PostgreSQL database to delivering insights through interactive dashboards and presentations. The goal is to showcase practical skills in data cleaning, SQL analysis, data visualization, and business communication.

The project includes:

- Database setup and querying using PostgreSQL

- Data cleaning and transformation

- Analytical SQL queries

- An interactive Tableau dashboard

- A written analytical report

- A presentation created using Gamma

# Dataset

Source: Provided dataset (CSV format)

Description: The dataset contains structured data suitable for analytical querying and visualization.

Scope: Includes raw records that require cleaning, normalization, and validation before analysis.

(Dataset details can be expanded here if public, e.g., number of rows, time period, key variables.)

# Tools & Technologies

Database: PostgreSQL

Querying & Analysis: SQL

Visualization: Tableau

Reporting: Written analytical report (PDF / DOC)

Presentation: Gamma

Environment: Local machine / PostgreSQL server

# Project Steps

- Data Loading

Imported the raw dataset into PostgreSQL using SQL scripts.

Created tables with appropriate data types and constraints.

- Data Cleaning

Removed duplicates and invalid records.

Handled missing values and inconsistent formats.

Standardized column values where necessary.

# SQL Analysis

Wrote SQL queries to explore trends, metrics, and key performance indicators.

Used joins, aggregations, filtering, and subqueries for analysis.

# Dashboard Development

Connected Tableau to the PostgreSQL database.

Built interactive visualizations to highlight insights.

Designed dashboards for clarity and usability.

# Reporting

Summarized findings, insights, and recommendations in a structured report.

Focused on business-relevant conclusions supported by data.

# Presentation

Created a concise presentation using Gamma.

Communicated insights visually for a non-technical audience.

# Dashboard

Tool: Tableau

Features:

- Interactive filters and drill-downs

- Key metrics and trend analysis

- Clean, recruiter-friendly design

- Dashboard available in above file named BookRentalCenterDashboard.png

# Results & Insights

Identified key trends and patterns in the data.

Highlighted actionable insights supported by SQL analysis.

Delivered findings in multiple formats (dashboard, report, presentation) to suit different stakeholders.

# How to Run the Project

- Set Up PostgreSQL

  Install PostgreSQL locally.

  Create a new database.

  Load the Data

  Run the provided SQL scripts to create tables.

  Import the dataset into PostgreSQL.

  Run SQL Queries

  Execute analysis queries in PostgreSQL to reproduce results.

  View the Dashboard

- Open the Tableau workbook.

  Connect to the PostgreSQL database.

  Refresh data if needed.

  Review Outputs
